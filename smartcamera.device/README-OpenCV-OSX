  Installing OpenCV on OSX Sierra
  
  I followed the directions below.
  You MUST include --with-java to get the OpenCV java bindings.
  You can exclude the python stuff if you like.

  The jar ends up here:  /usr/local/opt/opencv3/share/OpenCV/java/opencv-320.jar
  Its native library dependency (libopencv_java320.dylib) is in the same directory.
  
  To build in Eclipse you will also have to register the native lib for the jar
  -- gleaned from https://deepturf.com/2016/08/08/install-opencv-on-mac-osx/:
     Eclipse > Preferences > Java > Build Path > User Libraries
        New  > “opencv3”
        Select it and > Add External JARs
            SHIFT+CMD+G in finder to be able to see/input a real path
                /usr/local/opt/opencv3/share/OpenCV/java    - select opencv-320.jar
            After adding the jar expand it in the dialog and select “Native library location” > Edit
                add the same path - libopencv_java320.dylib is there - /usr/local/opt/opencv3/share/OpenCV/java
